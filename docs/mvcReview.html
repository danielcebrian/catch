<ul><li>lots of developers know it</li><li>very simple and unopinionated</li><li>has lost favor because it&#39;s very low level and doesn&#39;t provide a lot of what developers need, so they have to rely on third-party additions like Marionette or roll their own, resulting in hard-to-maintain code</li></ul>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js">Angular</a></h2>

<p>Strong contender for new Javascript MVC library of choice for most projects, produced by folks at Google</p>

<ul><li>easier to get started than Ember</li><li>comes from Google, so it may be a safe bet in terms of future-proofing the ecosystem</li><li>declarative style makes for readable markup and fewer lines of code</li><li>model layer may be less well designed than Ember&#39;s</li></ul>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/">Ember</a></h2>

<p>Other lead contender for new MVC library of choice, designed for large-scale, complex apps</p>
