<h1>Technology Decisions For The CATCH UI</h1>

<p>Outlines what libraries and frameworks were chosen and why.</p>

<h2>Grid Control / Library</h2>

<p>SlickGrid is the leading candidate, because:
- It seems to nicely decouple presentation from data management, not trying to solve ajax loading, etc., which we want to be done in the MVC, not in the grid control
- It seems to have the largest ecosystem among open-source JQuery-compatible grid controls</p>

<h2><a href="./mvcReview.md">MVC Framework</a> - more detail on front-end frameworks that were evaluated</h2>

<p>Angular is the leading candidate:
 - easy to implement quickly
 - big and growing ecosystem, supported by Google</p>

<p>Ember may also be a good choice. It&#39;s a heavy-duty, opinionated framework designed for complex apps that people spend a lot of time in. As such it may result in a better-engineered product at the expense of additional development time.</p>
