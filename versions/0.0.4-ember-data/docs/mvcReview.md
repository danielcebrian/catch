# Review of MVC Libraries for CATCH UI

## [Backbone](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone)

The original Javascript MVC framework

- lots of developers know it
- very simple and unopinionated
- has lost favor because it's very low level and doesn't provide a lot of what developers need, so they have to rely on third-party additions like Marionette or roll their own, resulting in hard-to-maintain code

## [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular.js)

Strong contender for new Javascript MVC library of choice for most projects, produced by folks at Google

- easier to get started than Ember
- comes from Google, so it may be a safe bet in terms of future-proofing the ecosystem
- declarative style makes for readable markup and fewer lines of code
- model layer may be less well designed than Ember's


## [Ember](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/)

Other lead contender for new MVC library of choice, designed for large-scale, complex apps

- [this thread](http://eviltrout.com/2013/06/15/ember-vs-angular.html) discusses grid controls, performance, etc. related ot ember vs angular

- designed for complex applications
- difficult learning curve
- powerful support for lots of features that may be needed
- strong model layer
