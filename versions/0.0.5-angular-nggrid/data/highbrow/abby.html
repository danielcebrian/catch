ever." [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=25246&stop=25311"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	A statement of fact by Ishmael first brings the reader into his mindset and worldview by explicitly saying "this is how it is here and now for me," which, in a first-person narration, is how the novel is. Then, he explains his reasons for retreating to the sea for "meditation" and rejuvination. He expects certain things from the upcoming voyage, but will he get them?</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Magic Water</div><div>In reference to: "There is magic
in it." [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=24877&stop=24897"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	Calling upon something bigger than himself, as well as supernatural, Ishmael submits himself, almost spiritually, to the sea. Is this "great American desert" a place of pilgrimage? What kind of occult comes from the ocean?</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Life Water</div><div>In reference to: "But that same image, we ourselves see
in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of
life; and this is the key to it all." [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=27117&stop=27262"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	This is my last water comment, I promise. Maybe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Ishmael has built up a very good argument about why he's going to sea. Did we really need the explanation? Water is inarguably important to humanity - as important to us as it is to a whale? Is this the start of some empathy for the great whale of the title?</p>
<p>
	Using "we" includes the reader in Ishmael's generalization and invites us to "hear the siren's song," so to speak, and join him on the ship (eventually). Hopefully, we won't meet the same fate as Narcissus.&nbsp;</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Untitled Note</div><div>In reference to: ""Spain--a great whale stranded on the shores of Europe." --EDMUND BURKE." [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=11545&stop=11616"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	Metaphor of the country of Spain as a beached whale prepares us to think of whales more symbolically, while some of these extracts are literal facts about whaling.</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Untitled Note</div><div>In reference to: " the great leviathan himself" [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=44084&stop=44111"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	Is there a whale in legend? The whale that swallowed Jonah?</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Untitled Note</div><div>In reference to: " secret
intelligence from the Deity" [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=433109&stop=433143"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	Whales in communication with God - they have a place in the natural order? Comparing them to human prayer?</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Untitled Note</div><div>In reference to: "eternal, living principle or
soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the
characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its outer
vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching
contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no
longer an integral. " [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=440180&stop=440498"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	Ahab's search makes him lose his soul? Ahab is possesed, his body is empty of himself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Not to make an anachronistic and divergent reference, but does this mean that the whale is Ahab's horcrux? Ahab as Voldemort is an interesting comparison - he's physically disfigured, set on wiping out particular being(s), uses his devoted followers as pawns to his end, and seeks prey that did nothing to him but be what he/it is.</p>
<p>
	Yay, Harry Potter!</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Untitled Note</div><div>In reference to: "he whose intense thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a
vulture feeds upon that heart for ever; that vulture the very creature
he creates" [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=441332&stop=441469"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	Comparing Ahab to more reputable literary characters works too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Prometheus was punished for stealing fire from the gods and giving it to humankind. What is it Ahab brings to humanity that warrants his punishment? The fire of whale oil? The fire of passionate obsession and revenge?</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Untitled Note</div><div>In reference to: "I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall
be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of
items, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from these
citations, I take it--the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of
itself." [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=442088&stop=442375"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	Ishmael spends a lot of time explaining himself, and steps out of the narrative to do so. Why does he need to &nbsp;continually prove that what he says he saw is actually true? We as readers know this novel is a work of fiction, so why spend so much time with the prefatory material and in the text to try to convince us that the events are plausible?</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Untitled Note</div><div>In reference to: "It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their
last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world more
fond of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical life
that I had done the same thing." [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=499265&stop=499506"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	Ishmael finally understands the imminent danger of whaling, and his natural response is to think about what will happen to his possessions and legacy after he dies. But, what does he have to leave behind? We know from earlier chapters that Ishmael is estranged from his family, and even if he builds a family on the Pequot there is a good (definite, in this case) chance that they will be lost as well. So, making a will is a sadly futile gesture, almost absurdist or existentialist in nature.&nbsp;</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Seeing Whales</div><div>In reference to: "For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs
conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world
which must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit
the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very
considerable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding
out precisely what the whale really looks like" [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=583335&stop=583729"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	This passage seems ironic given the number of visual depictions of Moby Dick and other whales in the novel we have seen since we began this unit. Of course, nowadays we have photographs and video of whales, and we can go see them in aquariums, so we definitely know what they look like. But, Moby Dick itself is a fictional whale - and as far as I know sperm whales aren't white in color - so this particular whale could look completely radical from other whales, lending itself to artistic depictions very well.</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Untitled Note</div><div>In reference to: " the mere skeleton
of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded
animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes
it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some
part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously
displayed in the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to
the bones of the human hand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four
regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But
all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human
fingers in an artificial covering." [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=582574&stop=583189"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	In the first chapter of the novel I thought the depiction of people migrating to the sea meant to equate humans with whales in some sense, and this passage bolsters that interpretation. Thinking about whales as more human and humans as more whale changes the practice of whaling significantly, and makes Ahab's revenge story all the more ghastly.&nbsp;</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:All the whales</div><div>In reference to: "Wooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of
the noble South Sea war-wood" [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=594597&stop=594695"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	Ishmael's repetitious descriptions and depictions of whales is a precursor to the obsessive retelling and reworking the novel has had since its publication. Seeing whales everywhere seems like something Ahab would experience in his pursuit of Moby Dick, but since whalers' livelihoods depend on whales as well, it makes sense that their towns would be bedecked in whale paraphernalia.</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Cannibalistic</div><div>In reference to: "that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea,
and eat it too by its own light" [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=654212&stop=654299"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	Here whaling and use of whale products seems somewhat incestuous and improper - should those who hunt whales not use the things they have harvested?</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:More cannibalism</div><div>In reference to: "Look at your knife-handle, there, my
civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what is
that handle made of?--what but the bones of the brother of the very ox
you are eating? And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring
that fat goose? With a feather of the same fowl. And with what quill did
the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders
formally indite his circulars?" [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=655202&stop=655624"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	Now humans just seem barbaric - or ingenious in another light</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Untitled Note</div><div>In reference to: "a vengeful ghost
survives and hovers over it to scare." [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=671776&stop=671829"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	Foreshadowing?</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Superstition</div><div>In reference to: "There's orthodoxy!" [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=672567&stop=672584"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	It seems that because of the dangerous nature of their work, whalers are incredibly supersitious. Their caution also seems to keep them relatively safe, because taking risks can either bag a whale or get you dead. Comparing this to Ahab and the crew, the captain's lack of discretion in his pursuit of Moby Dick can only lead to bad things.&nbsp;</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Untitled Note</div><div>In reference to: "An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow
lotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon
the sea" [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=675247&stop=675374"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	Pretty imagery, but none of it has to do with things of the sea. Why does Ishmael describe the beauty of the ocean by comparing it to things on the land?</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Untitled Note</div><div>In reference to: "copper" [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=741898&stop=741903"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	The bottom of the boat is covered in copper? To make it go faster? Ishmael's description in chapter 70 makes more sense now.&nbsp;</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Untitled Note</div><div>In reference to: "Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony,
but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly beautiful,
strength has much to do with the magic." [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=810842&stop=810992"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	A combination of strength and beauty seems exactly right for describing a whale, though Ahab would disagree saying it's sheerly powerful and demonic.</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Untitled Note</div><div>In reference to: "An allegorical meaning may lurk here." [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=867336&stop=867372"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	Ishmael seems to be merely entertaining himself by contemplating various aspects of whales and whaling, but the notion of who owns a whale is important. If we're operating within the metaphor that whales are like people, then wouldn't owning the corpse of a whale me morally reprehensible? Is it a kind of slavery?</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Untitled Note</div><div>In reference to: "full tidiness" [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=921637&stop=921649"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	I hadn't thought of the sailors cleaning themselves, or doing any other hygenic practices. Small details such as this do more to humanize the sailors and make them seem real than any grand reasoning Ishmael could put forth.&nbsp;</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Untitled Note</div><div>In reference to: "ivory limbs of the two
crippled captains" [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=946186&stop=946225"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	Moby Dick seems to have a propensity for dismembering those who hunt him. Why is it only captains who dare pursue the whale? Is Moby Dick too dangerous for normal harpooners, and would make off with more than just their limbs?</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Untitled Note</div><div>In reference to: "I am horror-struck
at this antemosaic, unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of
the whale, which, having been before all time, must needs exist after
all humane ages are over" [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=983338&stop=983520"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	So, whales came before humans and they will exist after humans, according to Ishmael. If this is so, especially considering the equation of god and whale by the natives, what business do men have hunting beings so superior to themselves?</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Untitled Note</div><div>In reference to: " the Delta of his forehead's veins swelled
like overladen brooks; in his very sleep" [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=1034952&stop=1035034"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	Comparing Ahab's blood to water, the "blood" of the sea makes his hunting whales seem even more barbaric if they rely on the same substance for survival.&nbsp;</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Untitled Note</div><div>In reference to: "when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the
ocean's skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and
would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but conceals a
remorseless fang." [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=1048340&stop=1048548"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	More descriptions of the sea using land animal metaphors.</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Untitled Note</div><div>In reference to: "AHAB STANDING BY THE HELM. STARBUCK APPROACHING HIM." [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=1081297&stop=1081348"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	More Stage directions - this has happened three times now, and each of the staged scenes are in regards to dialogue among the officers. Are these conflicts best shown rather than told? How does Ishmael know what they say?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	It's also interesting to consider the images of the characters on a stage or on the deck in light of the obsessive images surrounding <em>Moby Dick</em>.&nbsp;</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Famous Lines - Group 1</div><div>In reference to: ""There she blows!--there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is
Moby Dick!"" [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=1151348&stop=1151425"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	This is the first sighting of Moby Dick and one of the most recognized lines from the novel.&nbsp;</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Ahab is mean - Group 1</div><div>In reference to: ""And did none of ye see it before?" cried Ahab, hailing the perched men
all around him.

"I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I
cried out," said Tashtego.

"Not the same instant; not the same--no, the doubloon is mine, Fate
reserved the doubloon for me. I only; none of ye could have raised the
White Whale first. There she blows!--there she blows!--there she blows!
There again!--there again!"" [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=1152120&stop=1152545"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	Why would Ahab ask them if anyone else saw the spout first if he meant to claim the dubloon and the whale for himself? Did he just want to make fun of the rest of the crew?</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Mixed up time - Group 1</div><div>In reference to: "awaiting Moby Dick's reappearance.

"An hour," said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat's stern; and he gazed
beyond the whale's place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing
vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed
whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle." [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=1156687&stop=1156993"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	Ahab seems to be confusing the sequence of time because of the fervor of the hunt. He's been searching for Moby Dick for so long, it makes sense that he wouldn't be able to distinguish this chase from a possible earlier one.&nbsp;</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Projecting Emotions - Group 1</div><div>In reference to: "malicious intelligence" [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=1158419&stop=1158440"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	Ishmael is anthropomorphizing the whale - giving it emotions and qualities like "malicious," "vindictive," and "divine."</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Superstition - Group 1 </div><div>In reference to: ""Omen? omen?--the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to
man, they will honourably speak outright; not shake their heads, and
give an old wives' darkling hint.--Begone! " [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=1168150&stop=1168330"> context </a>] </div><div><p>
	The wreck is the omen, and it's irreverent to laugh?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The sailors use superstition to guide their lives, and without their navigational tools, what else do they have to go by.&nbsp;</p>
</div><hr><div>Title:Ahab's leg</div><div>In reference to: "his
ivory limb having been so violently displaced, that it had stake-wise
smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme
difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured." [<a href="http://highbrow.lib.harvard.edu/melville/moby_dick/class/muohio_eng352_spring2013#start=995725&stop=995920"> context </a>] </div><div></div><hr></body></html>
