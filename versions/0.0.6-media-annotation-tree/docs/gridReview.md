# Review of Grid Libraries for CATCH UI

## [JQuery UI Grid Widget](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/34246941/Grid)

- not available yet
- JQuery UI team supposedly evaluating the best features of Slickgrid, jqgrid, and DataTables and rolling them into an officla JQuery UI Grid Widget, but this effort has been underway for years and there's not much update


## [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki)

Quite simply, SlickGrid is a JavaScript grid/spreadsheet component.
It is an advanced component and is going to be a bit more difficult to learn and configure, but once you realize its full potential, it will blow your mind!

Here's a [very nice demo](http://mleibman.github.io/SlickGrid/examples/example-grouping)

- div based, not table based
- seems to have nice decoupling of data and presentation
- has the largest community
- appears to have been adopted by JQuery UI
- depends on JQuery
- has a lot of editing/spreadsheet functionality that wouldn't be relevant

## [DataTables](http://www.datatables.net/)

DataTables is a plug-in for the jQuery Javascript library. It is a highly flexible tool, based upon the foundations of progressive enhancement, which will add advanced interaction controls to any HTML table

- table based, not div

## [jqGrid](https://github.com/tonytomov/jqGrid)

Ajax-enabled grid control

- seems too coupled to backend


## [Backgrid](https://github.com/wyuenho/backgrid)

Backgrid.js is a set of components for building semantic and easily stylable data grid widgets. It offers a simple, intuitive programming interface that makes easy things easy, but hard things possible when dealing with tabular data.

- depends on Backbone (which depends on JQuery and Underscore)


## [Gridster](https://github.com/ducksboard/gridster.js)

Gridster is a jQuery plugin that makes building intuitive draggable layouts from elements spanning multiple columns. You can even dynamically add and remove elements from the grid.

- depends on JQuery

## [Recline.js](https://github.com/okfn/recline/)

A simple but powerful library for building data applications in pure Javascript and HTML.

## [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3)

Amazing JS data visualization library

- made for complex data visualization and graphics, not really for grid/tabular
- may be too complex, not having grid/tabular features
- example at http://bl.ocks.org/syntagmatic/3687826


## [Ember-Table](https://github.com/addepar/ember-table)

- depends on Ember.js and JQuery UI

## [ng-grid](http://angular-ui.github.io/ng-grid/)
