# Review of Grid Libraries for CATCH UI

## [Backgrid](https://github.com/wyuenho/backgrid)

Backgrid.js is a set of components for building semantic and easily stylable data grid widgets. It offers a simple, intuitive programming interface that makes easy things easy, but hard things possible when dealing with tabular data.

- depends on Backbone (which depends on JQuery and Underscore)


## [Gridster](https://github.com/ducksboard/gridster.js)

Gridster is a jQuery plugin that makes building intuitive draggable layouts from elements spanning multiple columns. You can even dynamically add and remove elements from the grid.

- depends on JQuery

## [Recline.js](https://github.com/okfn/recline/)

A simple but powerful library for building data applications in pure Javascript and HTML.



## [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki)

Quite simply, SlickGrid is a JavaScript grid/spreadsheet component.
It is an advanced component and is going to be a bit more difficult to learn and configure, but once you realize its full potential, it will blow your mind!

- seems to have nice decoupling of data and presentation
- has the largest community
- appears to have been adopted by JQuery UI
- depends on JQuery
- has a lot of editing/spreadsheet functionality that wouldn't be relevant


## [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3)

Amazing JS data visualization library

- made for complex data visualization and graphics, not really for grid/tabular
- may be too complex, not having grid/tabular features
- example at http://bl.ocks.org/syntagmatic/3687826


## [Ember-Table](https://github.com/addepar/ember-table)

- depends on Ember.js and JQuery UI
